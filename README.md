# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Project

Based on work by [Daniel Cummings]([URL](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/predicting-hospital-length-of-stay-at-time-of-admission-55dfdfe69598))

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of hospital patient data, focusing on key metrics such as Length of Stay (LOS), patient demographics, and diagnosis classifications. Utilizing Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, the project provides insightful visualizations and statistical summaries to enhance healthcare decision-making.

## Features 🌟

- **Data Loading and Preparation** 📂:
  - Import patient, ICU stay, admissions, and diagnosis data.
  - Clean and preprocess data for accurate analysis.
  
- **Length of Stay (LOS) Analysis** 📊:
  - Calculate and visualize LOS distributions.
  - Filter data to remove negative and deceased cases.

- **Ethnicity and LOS Comparison** 🌍:
  - Box and whisker plots to compare LOS across different ethnicities.

- **Religion and LOS Comparison** ✝️☪️✡️:
  - Bar charts to compare median LOS across religious categories.

- **Admission Type and LOS Comparison** 🏥:
  - Box and whisker plots to visualize LOS for different admission types.

- **Insurance Type and LOS Comparison** 💵:
  - Box and whisker plots to compare LOS for different insurance types.

- **Age Analysis** 🎂:
  - Calculate patient age at admission.
  - Categorize ages and visualize age distributions.
  - Scatter plots to examine the relationship between age and LOS.

- **Diagnosis Classification** 🏷️:
  - Group ICD9 codes into broad diagnosis categories.
  - Visualize the distribution of diagnosis groups.
